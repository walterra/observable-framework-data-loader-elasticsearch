# Elasticsearch + Observable Framework Examples

Elasticsearch is a powerful search and analytics engine that allows for scalable data storage and real-time querying. Observable Framework is a polyglot static site generator with a focus on data visualization and dashboards.

This site demonstrates how to use Elasticsearch as part of Framework's data loaders to fetch and transform data to be used in visualizations.

All source markup and code is available at https://github.com/walterra/observable-framework-data-loader-elasticsearch. Or, use the source links at the top of each page!

**Great news:** The original Elasticsearch data loader example created as part of this repo is now part of the [list of Frameworks's data loader examples](https://github.com/observablehq/framework/tree/main/examples#data-loaders) and hosted as part of the [official docs over at ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.observablehq.cloud/framework-example-loader-elasticsearch/!

Additional examples can still be found in this repository:
